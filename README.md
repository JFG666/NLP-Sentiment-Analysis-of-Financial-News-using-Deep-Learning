# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Financial-News-using-Deep-Learning

Abstract:

1. In this project, multiple deep learning models are built to perform sentiment analysis on financial news headlines.
2. The deep learning models include simple feedforward neural networks (FNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). A pre-trained BERT transformer model is also applied to evaluate its performance on financial sentiment analysis.
3. The models are evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC curve.
4. The results show that the deep learning models outperform the baseline models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The BERT transformer model achieves the highest accuracy among all models.
5. The results demonstrate that deep learning models can be used to perform sentiment analysis on financial news headlines with high accuracy and efficiency.
